# Student Management API

Welcome to the **Student Management API** built with **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, and **DTOs**. This API provides CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing students, including their `name`, `email`, and `studentId`. It uses **RESTful web services** and allows the client to interact with the student records in a MySQL database.

## Project Overview

The **Student Management API** is a simple, yet powerful API that allows users to manage student records. The project is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend, with **MySQL** as the database. It exposes a set of RESTful endpoints to interact with student data, including the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete student records.

---

## Features

- **Create** new student records with `name`, `email`, and `studentId`.
- **Read** a list of all students or retrieve a student by their unique `id`.
- **Update** an existing student's information.
- **Delete** student records from the system.
- Data is stored and retrieved from a **MySQL** database.
- Simple and intuitive **REST API** endpoints for easy integration.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11**
- **Spring Boot 2.x**
- **Spring Data JPA** for database interaction
- **MySQL** for the database
- **Lombok** for boilerplate code reduction
- **Postman** for testing the API endpoints

cd http-server-SpringBoot
```

### Configure the Database

1. **Install MySQL** if you donâ€™t have it installed already.
2. **Create a database** for the project:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE springdb;
```

3. Configure your MySQL connection settings in the `application.properties` file located in `src/main/resources`.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/springdb
spring.datasource.username=root
